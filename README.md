# Rychlokurz
Little family scoped programming course

I hope you don't mind english. If you do, let me know but the
world of code is engrained in this language.

## About

We will be coding in **Python**. The reasons are:
- Python is relatively easy to grasp, read and write
- It's usefull as heck both in personal life and widely used in commercial sphere
- It is very very popular and the interent is full of resources for it

But before we write our first program, we will first have to learn some periferal technologies.
We will start with **GIT** and **Markdown**.

I prepared **Lessons** folder with the first lesson **01_Repository**.

You can work your way to complete the lessons and let me know anytime with any problems, questions or when you finish a lesson.

## Tips and tricks

1. Google is your friend, ChatGPT is your God.

    If you haven't already create an account on [Chat GPT](chat.openai.com).
    You can ask it questions and it will answer. On your level of programming/cioding, it should be able to understand and help with most tasks.
    
    Just remember that
    1. ChatGpt can and will lie sometimes (It's pretty much just a very very good guessing engine)
    2. You should not rely on it to *solve* your problems. Use it to *help* you understand them.
    3. Most of its training data was in english -> It knows czech but it's "dumber" when speaking it.

    If you want, you can customize the chatbot in settings like this so that it can better assist you:

    **Custom instructions** (paste in *How would you like ChatGPT to respond?*)
    ```
    - Respond briefly
    - Have a dialogue with me
    - Before settling on a solution give me suggestions/thoughts first
    - Don't output code unless explicitly asked (Or just output short examples, not "solution code")
    - Feel free to ask for more code/additional information
    - Assume I am a novice programmer. I don't always know or use the correct terms and I want to learn more about the craft of coding.
    ```

    You can also use chat GPT for translations (and it's very good, ~5x better than google translate.)

2. You can never do anything wrong by watching (**and following!**) a 5 hour tutorial about how to code a snake (Or any other tutorial...)

3. Don't get discouraged
    
    It will take time before you feel comfortable in your programmer boots. Maybe never... there is always new stuff to learn.

    Baby steps are still steps forward;-)
